# General Gameplay Ideas

1. BTD style health. Red bricks have 1 hp, Blue bricks have 2 hp ect. Maybe thats the "extreme" part of Extreme Breakout??
2. Golden Ball. There is one golden ball, hitting it creates a new ball. You lose when the golden ball dies.
3. Browser port? Prepare for PirateSoftware GameJam
4. Mobile port? Can you do both at the same time?
