# General Gameplay Ideas

Fundamental Gameplay Loop
1. BTD style health. Red bricks have 1 hp, Blue bricks have 2 hp ect.
2. Golden Ball. There is one golden ball, hitting it creates a new ball. You lose when the golden ball dies.
(Don't really like the golden ball idea. Its extreme breakout, the point is managing dozens of balls at once').
3. Card type system like Shotgun King. One positive, one negative.



Other Ideas
1. Browser port? Prepare for PirateSoftware GameJam
2. Mobile port? Can you do both at the same time?
3. Death animation. See BTD Balloon popping.
4. SFX and Music
5. Balls should spawn at the bottom of the screen just above the paddle
6. Bricks should be further up the screen. Maybe move the score text?
