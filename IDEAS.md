# General Gameplay Ideas

1. BTD style health. Red bricks have 1 hp, Blue bricks have 2 hp ect. Maybe thats the "extreme" part of Extreme Breakout??
2. Golden Ball. There is one golden ball, hitting it creates a new ball. You lose when the golden ball dies.
3. Browser port? Prepare for PirateSoftware GameJam
4. Mobile port? Can you do both at the same time?
5. Death animation
6. SFX and Music
7. Balls should spawn at the bottom of the screen just above the paddle
8. Bricks should be further up the screen. Maybe move the score text?
